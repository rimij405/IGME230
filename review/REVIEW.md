#### Question 2 ####
**Which JavaScript keyword declares *variables*?**

*`let`*

#### Question 3 ####
**Which JavaScript keyword declares *constants*?**

*`const`*

#### Question 4 ####
**What happens when you try to change the value of a previously declared *constant value*?**

### Web Application 3 ###
**Introduction to Web Browser DOM**

#### Question 1 ####
**What does "CRUD" stand for?**

*Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete.*

#### Question 2 ####
**What happens when we try to use JavaScript DOM methods to access the contents of a page before it has loaded?**

*Elements, before the page loading, aren't initialized or even declared. JavaScript will not have references to these elements in this event.*

#### Question 3 ####
**What is the name of the DOM method that will return the first element that matches the given selector?**

*`querySelector()`*

#### Question 4 ####
**What is the name of the DOM method that will return** all **elements that match the given selector?**

*`querySelectorALL()`*

#### Question 5 ####

*The Developer Console (Web Inspector) provides a 'live' view of the HTML and CSS on a page, including reflections of any edits made to the page.*

#### Question 10 ####
**How can we add breakpoints to our code in the debugger, and inspect the values of variables?**

*Breakpoints can be added via the `debugger;` call, or, if you are using Chrome, through the Developer Console's UI options. The Dev. Console can also handle placing breakpoints on DOM elements, given a trigger for modification of the element itself.*

#### Question 11 ####
**What does the `debugger;` statement do?**

*The `dubuggger;` statement will stop code execution of the following line, and, if possible, call a debugging function. This only occurs when debugging is enabled.*
