                    Seeing how the victim's body, or what remained of it, was wedged between the grill of the 
                    Peterbilt 389 and the bumper of the 2008 Cadillac Escalade EXT, officer "Dirk" Dirksen 
                    wondered why reporters always used the phrase "sandwiched" to describe such a scene since 
                    there was nothing appetizing about it, but still, he thought, they might have a point 
                    because some of this would probably end up on the front of his shirt. — Joel Phillips, 
                    West Trenton, NJ

                    The winner of the 33rd edition of the Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest is Joel Phillips of 
                    West Trenton, New Jersey. An Alabama native, Joel teaches music theory and composition at 
                    Westminster Choir College in Princeton, New Jersey. He lives in West Trenton with his wife
                    and their three cats, gardens with gusto, and enjoys listening to his rock-star bassist 
                    son's original songs. He can tell you when René Magritte painted “The Castle of the 
                    Pyrenees” but not when someone is off sides in soccer. Phillips is the person who 
                    purposefully viewed the film “Ishtar” more than once.

                    Conceived to honor the memory of Victorian novelist Edward George Earl Bulwer-Lytton and 
                    to encourage unpublished authors who do not have the time to actually write books, the 
                    contest challenges entrants to compose bad opening sentences to imaginary novels. Bulwer 
                    was selected as patron of the competition because he opened his novel "Paul Clifford" 
                    (1830) with the immortal words, "It was a dark and stormy night." Lytton’s sentence 
                    actually parodied the line and went on to make a real sentence of it, but he originated 
                    the line "The pen is mightier than the sword," and the expression "the great unwashed." 
                    His best known work is "The Last Days of Pompeii" (1834), an historical novel that has 
                    been adapted for film multiple times.

                    As has happened every year since the contest went public in 1983, thousands of entries 
                    poured in not just from the United States and Canada but from such countries as England, 
                    Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland, Germany, Japan, Ireland, and Indonesia.

                    We can’t let the dastards win,” said Piper Bogdonovich to her fellow gardener, Mr. Sidney 
                    Beckworth Hammerstein, as she clenched her gloved hands into gnarly, fuzzed fists, 
                    “because if I have to endure another year after which my Royal Puffin buttercups come in 
                    second place to Marsha Engelstrom’s Fainting Dove Tear Drop peonies, I will find a machine
                     gun and leave my humanity card in the Volvo.” — Grey Harlowe, Salem, OR

                    Ozymandias looked upon his mighty statue and despaired, amazed that the sculptors could 
                    have gotten his nose so wrong and wishing the darned thing would just crumble into pieces 
                    and blow across the lone and level sands, but leaving his legs since they were actually 
                    rather flattering. — Margaret Stein, Omaha, NE

                    After weeks at sea, Captain Fetherstonhaugh and his hardy crew had at last crossed the 
                    halfway point, and he mused that the closest dry land now lay in the Americas, assuming 
                    of course that it was not raining there. — David Laatsch, Baton Rouge, LA

                    Certainly most people in Morris’ place would have had certain misgivings about being 
                    stranded aboard a life raft, facing the unrelenting hunger and the possibility of having 
                    to eat the weaker members of the crew just to eke out the chance of survival for a few 
                    more days, but as Morris was an Asiatic black bear he had absolutely no qualms about it 
                    whatsoever. — Charlie Hill, Auckland, New Zealand

                    A thousand miles from the coast a cheer went up from the burned, ragged survivors of the 
                    Cortez party as they descended upon the hapless prairie dog devouring skin, fur, blood, 
                    everything in their ravenous quest for sustenance since their expulsion, two months 
                    previously, from the Reno Holiday Inn without the concomitant expulsion from the safe of 
                    their wallets and passports.— Dave Hurt, Leicester, UK

                    beloved of voyagers wishing to shake the desert dust off their feet, Peter bought a 
                    French-language newspaper and realized, with dizzying dismay, that “Camille” can be a
