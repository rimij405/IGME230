                    <h1>Olympic Typewriters!</h1>
                    <p>2D, typing game, with a very cartoony and colorful look, inspired by the Summer Olympics.</p>

                    <h1>Game Treatment</h1>
                    <p>This proposal for project 1, takes the form of a game treatment document of a fictional game. Students are tasked with creating a promotional website (project 1) for a web game, application or, ‘experience,’ that they pitch to their professor (project 3). While project 3 may evolve over the course of the semester, this remains tailored to the purpose of, “Olympic Typewriters!”</p>

                        <h3>Story</h3>
                        <p>The Olympics are a time when people from all over the globe compete for various medals and worldwide recognition. By bringing that competitive feeling to the world of typing, players are inspired to become better typists. </p>
                        <p>In one particular sport - discus throwing - there is an emphasis on distance; by translating player effort and accuracy into the actions of their on-screen avatar, players can compete in various olympic-level mini-games through the use of their typing skills. In the player's career, they should hope to get better at typing and unlock new outfits for their avatar.</p>
                        <p>Players should be able to retain their scores, and, thus compete in very quick, 1~2 minute sessions. There is a sense of satisfaction in competing with scores others may place on the game, building a community of olympic proportions!</p>
