Students are tasked with creating a promotional website (project 1) for a web game, application or, ‘experience,’ that they pitch to their professor (project 3). While project 3 may evolve over the course of the semester, this remains tailored to the purpose of, “Olympic Typewriters!”</p>

                        <h3>Story</h3>
                        <p>The Olympics are a time when people from all over the globe compete for various medals and worldwide recognition. By bringing that competitive feeling to the world of typing, players are inspired to become better typists. </p>
                        <p>In one particular sport - discus throwing - there is an emphasis on distance; by translating player effort and accuracy into the actions of their on-screen avatar, players can compete in various olympic-level mini-games through the use of their typing skills. In the player's career, they should hope to get better at typing and unlock new outfits for their avatar.</p>
                        <p>Players should be able to retain their scores, and, thus compete in very quick, 1~2 minute sessions. There is a sense of satisfaction in competing with scores others may place on the game, building a community of olympic proportions!</p>

                        <h3>Aesthetic</h3>
                        <p>Drawing heavily on the branding from past Summer Olympic Games, the game parodies the feel of the real games. Since the game is 2D, using a cartoonish artstyle can highlight the lighthearted and fun nature of the game. While the player is competitive, it will communicate to them that nothing is at stake - there is no risk.</p>        
                        <p>The soundscape can be compared to Final Fantasy X's score during the segment of the game in which the characters play the exciting and highly watched blitzball. In other words, a thrilling musical score, with fanfare and trumpets, to make the player feel like they are at a prestigious athletic event.</p>        
                        <p>By reinforcing player actions with strong in-game sound effects and music, there opens up a lot of places for sound to be implemented. When players are successful in launching their items, it should be congratulated with fanfare. When players make a mistake, reinforcing that it is a mistake, visually and with sound, will help communicate the error.</p>
