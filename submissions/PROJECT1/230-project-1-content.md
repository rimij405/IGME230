# Project 1 - Proposal

**This is a proposal for Project 1's game design treament document. For project 1, we will be building a website to promote a web game or, 'experience.'**

## Olympic Typewriters!

Created by Ian Effendi

### I. High Concept
At the olympic games, players toss weights by typing complex word combinations; the faster you type, the further you throw!

***

### II. Genre
2D, typing game, with a very cartoony and colorful look, inspired by the Summer Olympics.

***

### III. Platform
Desktop only.

### IV. Story

The Olympics are a time when people from all over the globe compete for various medals and worldwide recognition. By bringing that competitive feeling to the world of typing, players are inspired to become better typists. 

In one particular sport - discus throwing - there is an emphasis on distance; by translating player effort and accuracy into the actions of their on-screen avatar, players can compete in various olympic-level mini-games through the use of their typing skills. In the player's career, they should hope to get better at typing and unlock new outfits for their avatar.

Players should be able to retain their scores, and, thus compete in very quick, 1~2 minute sessions. There is a sense of satisfaction in competing with scores others may place on the game, building a community of olympic proportions!

### V. Aesthetics

Drawing heavily on the branding from past Summer Olympic Games, the game parodies the feel of the real games. Since the game is 2D, using a cartoonish artstyle can highlight the lighthearted and fun nature of the game. While the player is competitive, it will communicate to them that nothing is at stake - there is no risk.

The soundscape can be compared to Final Fantasy X's score during the segment of the game in which the characters play the exciting and highly watched blitzball. In other words, a thrilling musical score, with fanfare and trumpets, to make the player feel like they are at a prestigious athletic event.

By reinforcing player actions with strong in-game sound effects and music, there opens up a lot of places for sound to be implemented. When players are successful in launching their items, it should be congratulated with fanfare. When players make a mistake, reinforcing that it is a mistake, visually and with sound, will help communicate the error.

### VI. Gameplay

**The following section covers the gameplay portion of the document.**

#### Mechanics

**Free Throw**
Players will charge their avatar's throwing ability by typing the words that appear on the screen within a given amount of time. The player's avatar will throw the disc on the player's third mistake.

**Best of Three**
Players will charge their avatar's throwing ability by typing the words that appear on screen. When a player makes their first mistake, the avatar will throw the disc. The player will be able to do this for three rounds, before the highest distance out of the three tosses is chosen and recorded.

Words will appear on the screen, in the form of floating gym equipment (mats, hurdles, poles), and players will have to complete the words before they fall to the bottom of the screen. As the game progresses, the materials will appear at a faster rate.

#### Control

Players can control the game using:
- Keyboard Controls

#### Onboarding

Players will be able to find the instructions in an interactive tutorial section, clearly marked from the main menu, in the game.

#### Player learning

Players will need to learn how to keep track of elements on the screen and touch type.

Players who are unable to touch type will not be able to consistently reach higher scores.
